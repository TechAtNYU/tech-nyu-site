Questions belong to StackOverflow
=====

GitHub is for issues and feature requests. Anything else belongs to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=skrollr).

Pull requests
=====

Will be ignored if the Travis build fails. Install grunt and run `grunt jshint qunit` locally before submitting pull requests.

Do not include build files in your pull request (e.g. `skrollr.min.js`).

Do not change the version number in your pull request.

Do not try to fix multiple issues or add multiple features with a single pull request. A pull request should only do one thing.
