# Tech@NYU Website
This is the source for Tech@NYU's awesome website.

## Getting Started
### Download the Dependencies
To install the project's dependencies, run the following commands at the root
of the directory:
```bash
# The following gems are necessary for compiling the Sass files.
gem install sass
gem install sass-globbing
gem install compass --pre
gem install breakpoint

# For compiling the LiveScript and Sass files.
npm install gulp -g
npm install
```

### Build/Run
The following command compiles the [LivesScript](http://livescript.net/) and
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) files that make up the project:
```
gulp --require gulp-livescript
```

To start the server, run `node server.js` in the `build/` directory. This
project is an Express app; to preview the site, visit `localhost:3000` in a web
browser.

If you want to develop so that the `gulp` does less minification (speeding up
build time), run
```
gulp dev --require gulp-livescript
```

### Architecture
#### Flight
This repo uses [flight](https://github.com/flightjs/flight) to build the webpage out of independent [components](https://github.com/TechAtNYU/tech-nyu-site/tree/master/src/public/scripts/components) that communicate with one another by sending out and responding to events. These components [can be](https://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/doc/mixin_api.md) augmented by composable [mixins](https://github.com/TechAtNYU/tech-nyu-site/blob/master/src/public/scripts/mixins.ls). This architecture, which is used by Twitter, makes the coupling between the different parts of the page much looser, so the resulting code is less brittle, and each component is fully testable in isolation.

#### Animations
Once you've grocked the flight architecture, the only other big thing to understand is how the animations are set up. Basically, different components can register animations ([example] (https://github.com/TechAtNYU/tech-nyu-site/blob/master/src/public/scripts/components/nav.ls#L33)) using the [animate mixin](https://github.com/TechAtNYU/tech-nyu-site/blob/master/src/public/scripts/mixins.ls#L43), which stores the animations in the DOM on `data-` attributes. For each node they're applied to, these attributes encode all of that node's animation instructions at each different design mode. (There are three design modes: Large Paginated, Large Scroll, and Small Scroll.) Then, a heavily-modified [skrollr-stylesheets](https://github.com/ethanresnick/skrollr-stylesheets/) [keeps track](https://github.com/ethanresnick/skrollr-stylesheets/blob/master/src/skrollr.stylesheets.js#L102) of which design mode is in view and loads only that mode's animations into the main [skrollr](https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr). (The skrollr library wasn't built for responsive design and can only handle one set of animations at a time, hence the need for skrollr-stylesheets to switch the animation instruction sets in and out as the design mode changes.) 

This picture is complicated a bit by the need to actually move around some elements in the DOM when the design mode, as not all the layout adjustments were possible with just CSS. Those changes are handled in the [skrollr component](https://github.com/TechAtNYU/tech-nyu-site/blob/master/src/public/scripts/components/skrollr.ls#L51), which in turn just sets up listeners for the `'designModeChange'` event. That event is thrown by the [designSwitcher component](https://github.com/TechAtNYU/tech-nyu-site/blob/master/src/public/scripts/components/designSwitcher.ls), which is just a really nice way to centralize keeping track of which design mode is currently being used and when the design mode changes, so that every single component doesn't have to track this stuff on it's own; other components can just listen to the `designModeChange` event.
