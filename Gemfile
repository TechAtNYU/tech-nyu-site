# Note: You *canâ€™t* use a version of sass higher than 3.3.13 or a version of
# compass higher than 1.0.0, as that breaks skrollr-stylesheets's compilation
# (see https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr-stylesheets/issues/46). And while
# this has since been fixed in the latest skrollr-stylesheets (see
# https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr-stylesheets/pull/47), it hasn't been
# fixed in our fork (https://github.com/ethanresnick/skrollr-stylesheets), which
# is used to support changing the set of animations in use depending on the
# screen size.
